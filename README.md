# Basic-Calculator-Using-Java.AWT-Package
This is a GUI Java program developed using Java.AWT package. This Java program has the advantage that one can add as many enhancements as one wants.


#Program Details:

->Author: Shubhanshu Jha

->Packages implemented:
1. java.awt package
2. java.awt.event package
3. java.util package

#Features of this Java program:

->Static GUI

->Appears at Center of Screen

->Displays the Previous Result

->Input/Output Size is capable of handling medium level computation (BigInteger Class not used)

->Good Implementation of WindowListener, ActionListener, and KeyListener

->Can do computations using Keyboard alone

->Calculator current available features can be checked from a Menu Button


#Current version of this Calculator Project supports the operation:

->Addition of Two Numbers

->Subtraction of Two Numbers

->Multiplication of Two Numbers

->Division of Two Numbers

->Modulus of Two Numbers

->LCM of Two Numbers

->HCF or GCD of Two Numbers

->Power Calculation (A to power B)



#To know the currently available operations in the Calculator:

->Click on the 'Supported Operation' button present in the MenuBar and you'll see the list of operations.


#How to use this calculator for different supported operations:

You can give the Two numbers in the "Give Input 1" and "Give Input 2" labeled TextField.

Give the operation you want to perform in the "Operation:" labeled TextField.

And, press Enter to do the computation or click on the "EVAL" button.

->To clear all fields, Click/Enter on the "CLEAR" button.

->To perform an operation, give the code/command/text associated with the operation:
1. Addition: +
2. Subtraction:  -
3. Multiplication:  *    or    x
4. Division:  /
5. Modulus:  %    or    MOD    or    mod
6. LCM:  LCM    or    lcm
7. HCF or GCD:  HCF    or    hcf    or    GCD    or    gcd
8. A to power B:  ^


->Previously computed result is displayed beside the "Previous Result:" labeled field.
