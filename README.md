# Basic-Calculator-Using-Java.AWT-Package
This is a GUI Java program developed using Java.AWT package. This Java program has the advantage that one can add as many enhancements as one wants.


## Program Details:

# ->Author: Shubhanshu Jha

# ->Packages implemented:
1. java.awt package
2. java.awt.event package
3. java.util package


# Features of this Java program:
```
->Static GUI

->Appears at Center of Screen

->Displays the Previous Result

->Input/Output Size is capable of handling medium level computation (BigInteger Class not used)

->Good Implementation of WindowListener, ActionListener, and KeyListener

->Can do computations using Keyboard alone

->Calculator current available features can be checked from a Menu Button
```


# Current version of this Calculator Project supports the operation:
```
->Addition of Two Numbers

->Subtraction of Two Numbers

->Multiplication of Two Numbers

->Division of Two Numbers

->Modulus of Two Numbers

->LCM of Two Numbers

->HCF or GCD of Two Numbers

->Power Calculation (A to power B)
```



# To know the currently available operations in the Calculator:

->Click on the 'Supported Operation' button present in the MenuBar and you'll see the list of operations.



# How to use this calculator for different supported operations:

You can give the Two numbers in the "Give Input 1" and "Give Input 2" labeled TextField.

Give the operation you want to perform in the "Operation:" labeled TextField.

And, press Enter to do the computation or click on the "EVAL" button.



->To clear all fields, Click/Enter on the "CLEAR" button.



->To perform an operation, give the code/command/text associated with the operation:
```
1. Addition: +
2. Subtraction:  -
3. Multiplication:  *    or    x
4. Division:  /
5. Modulus:  %    or    MOD    or    mod
6. LCM:  LCM    or    lcm
7. HCF or GCD:  HCF    or    hcf    or    GCD    or    gcd
8. A to power B:  ^
```


->Previously computed result is displayed beside the "Previous Result:" labeled field.
